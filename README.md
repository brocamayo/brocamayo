## 🧠 What I Do
I sit at the intersection of **program management, investing, and applied AI**.  
My work focuses on breaking down complexity—whether that’s large cross-functional programs, financial markets, or data workflows—and rebuilding it into something scalable and actionable.

---

## 🔧 Current Focus
```text
• AI + automation for decision-making
• Stock market analysis & portfolio strategy
• Data visualization & analytics (Power BI)
• Building repeatable systems (work + investing)


def decision_framework(problem):
    understand_constraints(problem)
    reduce_noise()
    identify_leverage()
    execute_simply()


### Why this version is strong
- ✅ One paste, zero cleanup  
- ✅ Reads like a **builder/operator**, not a student  
- ✅ Signals **PM + AI + investing** without overclaiming  
- ✅ Future-proof as you add repos and projects  

If you want next, I can:
- Add **minimal GitHub stats** (tasteful, not noisy)
- Tune this for **AI / TPM / Program Manager recruiting**
- Create a **“Projects Roadmap”** section to guide what you build next

Just say the word.
